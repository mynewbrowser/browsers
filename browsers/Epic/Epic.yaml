Name: Epic
Short Description: Epic is a privacy-centric Chromium-based web browser
Description: Epic is a privacy-centric web browser designed to prioritize user anonymity
  and security. With a focus on protecting user privacy, it blocks trackers, cookies,
  cryptominers, and other tracking elements that compromise online anonymity. Epic's
  encrypted proxy service, known as the Epic Privacy Browser Proxy, further enhances
  privacy by hiding the user's IP address and encrypting their browsing data. The
  browser is tailored to prevent data collection by default and features a "One-Click
  Encryption" option to secure web searches and connections. Additionally, Epic offers
  a built-in ad blocker and fingerprinting protections to safeguard user data while
  browsing the internet.
