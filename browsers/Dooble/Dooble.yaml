Short Description: Dooble is a minimal, scientific and stable browser
Description: Dooble is a privacy-focused web browser emphasizing user security and
  anonymity. With a minimalist interface, it integrates features such as encrypted
  browsing, secure browsing mode, and a built-in privacy manager for cookies, cache,
  and history. Its design prioritizes user privacy by default, aiming to shield users
  from online tracking and data collection. Additionally, Dooble incorporates options
  for customizing security settings and provides a clean browsing experience centered
  on user confidentiality. Dooble is designed to be portable with the user interface
