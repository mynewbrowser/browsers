Name: Tor
Short Description: Tor is a browser for anonymous web surfing and protection against
  traffic analysis
Description: Tor is a free and open-source web browser that protects your privacy
  by routing your traffic through a network of volunteer-operated servers. This makes
  it difficult for anyone to track your online activity or your real-world identity.
  Tor is especially useful for people who need to protect their anonymity, such as
  journalists, activists, and political dissidents.
