Name: Brave
Short Description: Brave is a privacy-focused browser with optional rewards for browsing
Description: Brave is a privacy-focused web browser that prioritizes user security
  and data protection. Built on the Chromium open-source project, it offers a familiar
  browsing experience while integrating enhanced privacy features. With built-in ad-blocking
  and tracker-blocking capabilities, Brave aims to provide a faster and more secure
  browsing experience by blocking intrusive advertisements and preventing websites
  from tracking users' online activities. Additionally, Brave offers a unique feature
  called Brave Rewards, allowing users to opt-in to view privacy-respecting ads and
  earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), a form of cryptocurrency, as a reward for their
  attention while browsing the web.
